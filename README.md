# Go Web Backend & React Frontend

This repository contains a Go-based web backend (using Gin, GORM, and PostgreSQL) and a React-based frontend (using Vite). The project features user authentication via Phantom wallet, JWT-based sessions, database migrations, and comprehensive API documentation generated by Swagger.

## Overview

- Backend:
  - Developed with Go, leveraging the Gin framework.
  - Uses PostgreSQL for data storage with GORM as the ORM.
  - Configuration managed by Viper.
  - Integrates Phantom wallet for user authentication and handles JWT for session management.
  - Provides auto-generated Swagger API docs for easy endpoint reference.

- Frontend:
  - Built with React (TypeScript), bundled by Vite.
  - Includes Chakra UI for components and layout.
  - Facilitates Phantom wallet integration for a seamless Solana-based experience.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or later
- Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) for the React frontend
- A running PostgreSQL instance
- (Optional) Docker/Docker Compose for container-based deployment

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/GabbyWorld/all-time-high-backend.git
   cd all-time-high-backend
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   - In the server directory, copy the sample file:
     ```
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     Fill in the required fields (database credentials, OpenAI keys, etc.).
   - For the frontend, environment variables can be set within Vite configs or .env files as necessary.

3. Install dependencies:
   - Backend:
     ```
     make deps
     ```
   - Frontend (inside the "web" folder):
     ```
     npm install
     ```
     (You may use yarn or pnpm if you prefer.)

4. Build and run the Go server:
   ```
   make run
   ```
   By default, the server listens on port 9100 (configurable in your .env file).

5. Optionally generate Swagger documentation (if you want to regenerate the docs):
   ```
   make swagger
   ```

6. Run the frontend:
   - From the "web" directory:
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```
   - The default development port is 3000. Adjust in vite.config.ts if needed.

## Docker Usage

A sample Dockerfile is provided for the Go backend. You can build and run it as follows:
